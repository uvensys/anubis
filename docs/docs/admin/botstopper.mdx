title: "Commercial support and an unbranded version"
---

If you want to use Anubis but organizational policies prevent you from using the branding that the open source project ships, we offer a commercial version of Anubis named BotStopper. BotStopper builds off of the open source core of Anubis and offers organizations more control over the branding, including but not limited to:

- Custom images for different states of the challenge process (in process, success, failure)
- Custom CSS and fonts
- Custom titles for the challenge and error pages
- "Anubis" replaced with "BotStopper" across the UI
- A private bug tracker for issues

In the near future this will expand to:

- A private challenge implementation that does advanced fingerprinting to check if the client is a genuine browser or not
- Advanced fingerprinting via [Thoth-based advanced checks](./thoth.mdx)

In order to sign up for BotStopper, please do one of the following:

- Sign up [on GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Xe) at the $50 per month tier or higher
- Email [sales@techaro.lol](mailto:sales@techaro.lol) with your requirements for invoicing, please note that custom invoicing will cost more than using GitHub Sponsors for understandable overhead reasons

## Installation

Install BotStopper like you would Anubis, but replace the image reference. EG:

```diff
-ghcr.io/techarohq/anubis:latest
+ghcr.io/techarohq/botstopper/anubis:latest
```

### Binary packages

Binary packages are available [in the GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/botstopper/releases), the main difference is that the package name is `techaro-botstopper`, the systemd service is `techaro-botstopper@your-instance.service`, the binary is `/usr/bin/botstopper`, and the configuration is in `/etc/techaro-botstopper`. All other instructions in the [native package install guide](./native-install.mdx) apply.

### Docker / Podman

In order to pull the BotStopper image, you need to [authenticate with GitHub's Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#authenticating-to-the-container-registry).

```text
docker login ghcr.io -u your-username --password-stdin
```

Then you can use the image as normal.

### Kubernetes

If you are using Kubernetes, you will need to create an image pull secret:

```text
kubectl create secret docker-registry \
  techarohq-botstopper \
  --docker-server ghcr.io \
  --docker-username your-username \
  --docker-password your-access-token \
  --docker-email your@email.address
```

Then attach it to your Deployment:

```diff
     spec:
       securityContext:
         fsGroup: 1000
+      imagePullSecrets:
+      - name: techarohq-botstopper
```

## Configuration

### Docker compose

Follow [the upstream Docker compose directions](https://anubis.techaro.lol/docs/admin/environments/docker-compose) with the following additional options:

```diff
   anubis:
     image: ghcr.io/techarohq/botstopper/anubis:latest
     environment:
       BIND: ":8080"
       DIFFICULTY: "4"
       METRICS_BIND: ":9090"
       SERVE_ROBOTS_TXT: "true"
       TARGET: "http://nginx"
       OG_PASSTHROUGH: "true"
       OG_EXPIRY_TIME: "24h"

+      # botstopper config here
+      CHALLENGE_TITLE: "Doing math for your connnection!"
+      ERROR_TITLE: "Something went wrong!"
+      OVERLAY_FOLDER: /assets
+    volumes:
+      - "./your_folder:/assets"
```

#### Example

There is an example in [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/botstopper/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml). Start the example with `docker compose up`:

```text
docker compose up -d
```

And then open [https://botstopper.local.cetacean.club:8443](https://botstopper.local.cetacean.club:8443) in your browser.

> [!NOTE]  
> This uses locally signed sacrificial TLS certificates stored in `./demo/pki`. Your browser will rightly reject these. Here is what the example looks like:
>
> ![](/img/botstopper/example-screenshot.webp)

## Custom images and CSS

Anubis uses an internal filesystem that contains CSS, JavaScript, and images. The BotStopper variant of Anubis lets you specify an overlay folder with the environment variable `OVERLAY_FOLDER`. The contents of this folder will be overlaid on top of Anubis' internal filesystem, allowing you to easily customize the images and CSS.

Your directory tree should look like this, assuming your data is in `./your_folder`:

```text
./your_folder
└── static
    ├── css
    │   └── custom.css
    └── img
        ├── happy.webp
        ├── pensive.webp
        └── reject.webp
```

For an example directory tree using some off-the-shelf images the Tango icon set, see the [testdata](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/botstopper/tree/main/testdata/static/img) folder.

### Custom CSS

CSS customization is done mainly with CSS variables. View [the example custom CSS file](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/botstopper/blob/main/testdata/static/css/custom.css) for more information about what can be customized.

### Custom fonts

If you want to add custom fonts, copy the `woff2` files alongside your `custom.css` file and then include them with the [`@font-face` CSS at-rule](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face):

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Oswald";
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 200 900;
  font-display: swap;
  src: url("./fonts/oswald.woff2") format("woff2");
}
```

Then adjust your CSS variables accordingly:

```css
:root {
  --body-sans-font: Oswald, sans-serif;
  --body-preformatted-font: monospace;
  --body-title-font: serif;
}
```

To convert `.ttf` fonts to [Web-optimized woff2 fonts](https://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF2/), use the `woff2_compress` command from the `woff2` or `woff2-tools` package:

```console
$ woff2_compress oswald.ttf
Processing oswald.ttf => oswald.woff2
Compressed 159517 to 70469.
```

Then you can import and use it as normal.

### Customizing images

Anubis uses three images to visually communicate the state of the program. These are:

| Image name     | Intended message                                 | Example                           |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| `happy.webp`   | You have passed validation, all is good          | ![](/img/botstopper/happy.webp)   |
| `pensive.webp` | Checking is running, hold steady until it's done | ![](/img/botstopper/pensive.webp) |
| `reject.webp`  | Something went wrong, this is a terminal state   | ![](/img/botstopper/reject.webp)  |

To make your own images at the optimal quality, use the following ffmpeg command:

```text
ffmpeg -i /path/to/image -vf scale=-1:384 happy.webp
```

`ffprobe` should report something like this on the generated images:

```text
Input #0, webp_pipe, from 'happy.webp':
  Duration: N/A, bitrate: N/A
  Stream #0:0: Video: webp, none, 25 fps, 25 tbr, 25 tbn
```

In testing 384 by 384 pixels gives the best balance between filesize, quality, and clarity.

```text
$ du -hs *
4.0K    happy.webp
 12K    pensive.webp
8.0K    reject.webp
```

## Customizing messages

You can customize messages using the following environment variables:

| Message              | Environment variable | Default                                    |
| :------------------- | :------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| Challenge page title | `CHALLENGE_TITLE`    | `Ensuring the security of your connection` |
| Error page title     | `ERROR_TITLE`        | `Error`                                    |

For example:

```sh
# /etc/techaro-botstopper/gitea.env
CHALLENGE_TITLE="Wait a moment please!"
ERROR_TITLE="Client error"
```
