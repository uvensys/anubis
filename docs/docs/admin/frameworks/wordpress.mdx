## Using a multi-site setup with Anubis

If you have a multi-site setup where traffic goes through Anubis like this:

```mermaid
---
title: Apache as tls terminator and HTTP router
---

flowchart LR
    T(User Traffic)
    subgraph Apache 2
        TCP(TCP 80/443)
        US(TCP 3001)
    end

    An(Anubis)
    B(Backend)

    T --> |TLS termination| TCP
    TCP --> |Traffic filtering| An
    An --> |Happy traffic| US
    US --> |whatever you're doing| B
```

Wordpress may not realize that the underlying connection is being done over HTTPS. This could lead to a redirect loop in the `/wp-admin/` routes. In order to fix this, add the following to your `wp-config.php` file:

```php
if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO']) && $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO'] === 'https') {
    $_SERVER['HTTPS'] = 'on';
    $_SERVER['SERVER_PORT'] = 443;
}
```

This will make Wordpress think that your connection is over HTTPS instead of plain HTTP.
