# Open Graph Configuration

This page provides detailed information on how to configure [OpenGraph tag](https://ogp.me/) passthrough in Anubis. This enables social previews of resources protected by Anubis without having to exempt each scraper individually.

## Configuration Options

| Name                     | Description                                               | Type     | Default | Example                         |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|---------------------------------|
| `OG_PASSTHROUGH`         | Enables or disables the Open Graph tag passthrough system | Boolean  | `false` | `OG_PASSTHROUGH=true`           |
| `OG_EXPIRY_TIME`         | Configurable cache expiration time for Open Graph tags    | Duration | `24h`   | `OG_EXPIRY_TIME=1h`             |
| `OG_CACHE_CONSIDER_HOST` | Enables or disables the use of the host in the cache key  | Boolean  | `false` | `OG_CACHE_CONSIDER_HOST=true`   |

## Usage

To configure Open Graph tags, you can set the following environment variables, environment file or as flags in your Anubis configuration:

```sh
export OG_PASSTHROUGH=true
export OG_EXPIRY_TIME=1h
export OG_CACHE_CONSIDER_HOST=false
```

## Implementation Details

When `OG_PASSTHROUGH` is enabled, Anubis will:

1. Check a local cache for the requested URL's Open Graph tags.
2. If a cached entry exists and is still valid, return the cached tags.
3. If the cached entry is stale or not found, fetch the URL, parse the Open Graph tags, update the cache, and return the new tags.

The cache expiration time is controlled by `OG_EXPIRY_TIME`.

When `OG_CACHE_CONSIDER_HOST` is enabled, Anubis will include the host in the cache key for Open Graph tags. This ensures that tags are cached separately for different hosts.

## Example

Here is an example of how to configure Open Graph tags in your Anubis setup:

```sh
export OG_PASSTHROUGH=true
export OG_EXPIRY_TIME=1h
export OG_CACHE_CONSIDER_HOST=false
```

With these settings, Anubis will cache Open Graph tags for 1 hour and pass them through to the challenge page, not considering the host in the cache key.

## When to Enable `OG_CACHE_CONSIDER_HOST`

In most cases, you would want to keep `OG_CACHE_CONSIDER_HOST` set to `false` to avoid unnecessary cache fragmentation. However, there are some scenarios where enabling this option can be beneficial:

1. **Multi-Tenant Applications**: If you are running a multi-tenant application where different tenants are hosted on different subdomains, enabling `OG_CACHE_CONSIDER_HOST` ensures that the Open Graph tags are cached separately for each tenant. This prevents one tenant's Open Graph tags from being served to another tenant's users.

2. **Different Content for Different Hosts**: If your application serves different content based on the host, enabling `OG_CACHE_CONSIDER_HOST` ensures that the correct Open Graph tags are cached and served for each host. This is useful for applications that have different branding or content for different domains or subdomains.

3. **Security and Privacy Concerns**: In some cases, you may want to ensure that Open Graph tags are not shared between different hosts for security or privacy reasons. Enabling `OG_CACHE_CONSIDER_HOST` ensures that the tags are cached separately for each host, preventing any potential leakage of information between hosts.
