# Meta Refresh (No JavaScript)

The `metarefresh` challenge sends a browser a much simpler challenge that makes it refresh the page after a set period of time. This enables clients to pass challenges without executing JavaScript.

To use it in your Anubis configuration:

```yaml
# Generic catchall rule
- name: generic-browser
  user_agent_regex: >-
    Mozilla|Opera
  action: CHALLENGE
  challenge:
    difficulty: 1 # Number of seconds to wait before refreshing the page
    report_as: 4 # Unused by this challenge method
    algorithm: metarefresh # Specify a non-JS challenge method
```

This is not enabled by default while this method is tested and its false positive rate is ascertained. Many modern scrapers use headless Google Chrome, so this will have a much higher false positive rate.
