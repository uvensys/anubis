## Anubis has the ability to let you import snippets of configuration into the main
## configuration file. This allows you to break up your config into smaller parts
## that get logically assembled into one big file.
##
## Of note, a bot rule can either have inline bot configuration or import a
## bot config snippet. You cannot do both in a single bot rule.
##
## Import paths can either be prefixed with (data) to import from the common/shared
## rules in the data folder in the Anubis source tree or will point to absolute/relative
## paths in your filesystem. If you don't have access to the Anubis source tree, check
## /usr/share/docs/anubis/data or in the tarball you extracted Anubis from.

      <h2>Techaro Anubis</h2>

      <p>This website uses a service called <a href="https://anubis.techaro.lol">Anubis</a> to filter malicious traffic. Anubis requires the use of browser cookies to ensure that web clients are running conformant software. Anubis also may report the following data to Techaro to improve service quality:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>IP address (for purposes of matching against geo-location and BGP autonomous systems numbers), which is stored in-memory and not persisted to disk.</li>
        <li>Unique browser fingerprints (such as HTTP request fingerprints and encryption system fingerprints), which may be stored on Techaro's side for a period of up to one month.</li>
        <li>HTTP request metadata that may include things such as the User-Agent header and other identifiers.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This data is processed and stored for the legitimate interest of combatting abusive web clients. This data is encrypted at rest as much as possible and is only decrypted in memory for the purposes of fulfilling requests.</p>

# By default, send HTTP 200 back to clients that either get issued a challenge
# or a denial. This seems weird, but this is load-bearing due to the fact that
# the most aggressive scraper bots seem to really, really, want an HTTP 200 and
# will stop sending requests once they get it.
status_codes:
  CHALLENGE: 200
  DENY: 200
